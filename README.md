# Back To The Kitchen

## Context
This is a student project with a team of 4 people, during 2 weeks.

The first goal was to learn about making VR game using Unity. We started with the XR Interaction Toolkit as base controller, and we built up features with those interactions.

So, it's VR coop game where you have to prepare burgers in a restaurant.
Cutting ingrdients, cooking meat and assembling burgers are the main features.
